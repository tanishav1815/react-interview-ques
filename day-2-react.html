        ques:-- How do you switch/navigate form one component to another in React?

        ans:-- 1. Link
        Link is used to manage the navigation and it worked as an anchor tag. Check below code for the demonstration.

       <b> {
        "import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
...
...
<Link to="/about">About</Link>"
    }</b>


        2. NavLink
NavLink behaves the same as Link but in addition, it comes with a new attribute called “activeClassName” which helps us to add the class to the anchor tag when page url will match.



<b>{
    "import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
    ...
    ...
    <NavLink activeClassName="active" to="/about">About</NavLink>"
}</b>

        The functional component only receives props from parent component and return you JSX elements.
        The functional component doesn’t play with any lifecycle methods of React and doesn’t play with the component state.


        Class component or statefull component

React class component is called as a stateful component.
Stateful component plays with all life cycle methods of React.
This component will modify state.
